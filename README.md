The Business Control Application helps to organize and supervise the work of employees working on away from the office.

The application consists of two parts - a mobile employee application and admin panel. 

The admin panel is designed for the manager, who led the team. The mobile application allows an employee to get a job and start its implementation, and the job tracking is sent to the admin with an interval of 15 minutes.
